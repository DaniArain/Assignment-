3.	Write a program in which use all the operators we can use in Python
# Q3: Use all operators in Python
a, b = 10, 3

# Arithmetic Operators
print("Addition:", a + b)
print("Subtraction:", a - b)
print("Multiplication:", a * b)
print("Division:", a / b)
print("Floor Division:", a // b)
print("Modulus:", a % b)
print("Exponent:", a ** b)

# Comparison Operators
print("Equal:", a == b)
print("Not Equal:", a != b)
print("Greater than:", a > b)
print("Less than:", a < b)
print("Greater or Equal:", a >= b)
print("Less or Equal:", a <= b)

# Logical Operators
x, y = True, False
print("AND:", x and y)
print("OR:", x or y)
print("NOT:", not x)

# Assignment Operators
c = 5
c += 2
print("c after += 2:", c)
c *= 3
print("c after *= 3:", c)

# Bitwise Operators
print("Bitwise AND:", a & b)
print("Bitwise OR:", a | b)
print("Bitwise XOR:", a ^ b)
print("Bitwise NOT:", ~a)
print("Bitwise Shift Left:", a << 1)
print("Bitwise Shift Right:", a >> 1)

4.	Completes the following steps of small task:
•	Mention Marks of English , Islamiat and Maths out of 100 in 3 different variables
•	Mention Variable of Total Marks and assign 300 to it
•	Calculate Percentage
# Q4: Marks and Percentage Calculation
english = 85
islamiat = 90
maths = 95

total_marks = 300
obtained_marks = english + islamiat + maths
percentage = (obtained_marks / total_marks) * 100

print("Obtained Marks:", obtained_marks)
print("Percentage:", percentage, "%")
